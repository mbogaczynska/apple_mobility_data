The aim of this project is to analyze the mobility data made avaiable by Apple.
That data is avaiable from the following URL:
https://covid19-static.cdn-apple.com/mobility

### Change log

* 2020-09-17: Initialize git repository for the project and commit all files 
into the repository
* 2020-09-12: A new version of the data file was downloaded, and I
also worked to refractor the code to be more general and to allow for any
state to be subset from the larger file. 
* 2020-08-29: The data was originally downloaded for analysis.
